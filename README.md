# neural-style

An implementation of [neural style][paper] in TensorFlow.

This implementation is a lot simpler than a lot of the other ones out there,
thanks to TensorFlow's really nice API and [automatic differentiation][ad].

TensorFlow doesn't support [L-BFGS][l-bfgs] (which is what the original authors
used) directly, so this implementation uses [TF External Optimizer][tf_ext_optimizer]
(examples on how to use it could be found [here][tf_ext_optimizer_test] and
[here][tf_ext_optimizer_test]) to utilize L-BFGS and CG optimizers. Using TF's [Adam][adam]
optimizer is also an option, although this may require a little bit more hyperparameter
tuning to get nice results. In order to specify which optimizer to use, `--optim`
command line argument, e.g. `--optim cg` if you want to use CG optimizer.

Be careful with checkpoints (see below) when using CG or L-BFGS, as each checkpoint
splits the optimization procedure, which might negatively affect the convergence.

**See [here][lengstrom-fast-style-transfer] for an implementation of [fast
(feed-forward) neural style][fast-neural-style] in TensorFlow.**

## Running

`python neural_style.py --content <content file> --styles <style file> --output <output file>`

Run `python neural_style.py --help` to see a list of all options.

Use `--checkpoint-output` and `--checkpoint-iterations` to save checkpoint images.

Use `--iterations` to change the number of iterations (default 1000).  For a 512×512 pixel content file, 1000 iterations take 2.5 minutes on a GeForce GTX Titan X GPU, or 90 minutes on an Intel Core i7-5930K CPU.

## Example 1

Running it for 500-2000 iterations seems to produce nice results. With certain
images or output sizes, you might need some hyperparameter tuning (especially
`--content-weight`, `--style-weight`, and `--learning-rate`).

The following example was run for 1000 iterations to produce the result (with
default parameters):

![output](examples/1-output.jpg)

These were the input images used (me sleeping at a hackathon and Starry Night):

![input-content](examples/1-content.jpg)

![input-style](examples/1-style.jpg)

## Example 2

The following example demonstrates style blending, and was run for 1000
iterations to produce the result (with style blend weight parameters 0.8 and
0.2):

![output](examples/2-output.jpg)

The content input image was a picture of the Stata Center at MIT:

![input-content](examples/2-content.jpg)

The style input images were Picasso's "Dora Maar" and Starry Night, with the
Picasso image having a style blend weight of 0.8 and Starry Night having a
style blend weight of 0.2:
