# Win Batch script helpers

These small files are basically templates to help use the python scripts in batched and somewhat automated fashion.
Currently, they are designed to be copied over the repo root with further manual editing to set up proper list of
files to process (as well as required paths) - those are defined using `set` at the beginning of the script.
